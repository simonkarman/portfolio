Flocking is a demo application that shows Flocking behaviour. This project was part of the course Artificial Intelligence during my bachelors.

The assignment was to implement Flocking in an existing program. The program already contained the classes for drawing entities to the screen, however it lacked movement. What we had to add was a flocking implementation consisting of the three rules of Flocking:
1. Alignment
2. Cohesion
3. Seperation

This demo application gave some promosing end results.
