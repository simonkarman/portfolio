'__KARMAN__' is a map pack that contains 17 trackmania maps, that I created for the game [Trackmania 2020](https://www.trackmania.com/). You can play the game for free.

Trackmania is a racing game where you compete for the fastest time on user created maps, every millisecond counts. The game features a map editor in which users can create the own tracks.

You can download my tracks from this project, you can find them in the Trackmania 2020 game in the __KARMAN Maps__ club, or you can find my tracks on [trackmania.exchange](https://trackmania.exchange/mapsearch2/index?mode=1&authorid=46114)

The first eight tracks of this pack are tracks where I'm getting familiar with the ingame track editor, while maps 09 until 17 are maps where I tried to put my mapmaking skills to the test. These maps have the following characteristics.
- __KARMAN_09__ - Tech Competitive Transitional
- __KARMAN_10__ - SpeedFun Mixed Transitional
- __KARMAN_11__ - SpeedFun Mixed
- __KARMAN_12__ - SpeedFun Transitional Grass
- __KARMAN_13__ - Tech Stunt Grass
- __KARMAN_14__ - SpeedFun Dirt Transitional
- __KARMAN_15__ - Tech MultiLap Stunt
- __KARMAN_16__ - SpeedFun Transitional Water
- __KARMAN_17__ - Dirt Stunt Transitional

To play these maps you can download them from this project, or search for the club '__Karman Maps__' in the Trackmania 2020 game, or you can download them at [trackmania.exchange by SKamii](https://trackmania.exchange/mapsearch2/index?mode=1&authorid=46114).

If you have any feedback or you would like to give my maps an award, please do so on [trackmania.exchange](https://trackmania.exchange/user/profile/46114).
