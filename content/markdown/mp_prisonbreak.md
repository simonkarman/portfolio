# How to Play
You need Call of Duty 4 - Patch 1.7 to play this map.

To 'install' this map you'll have to extract all the files from the cod4 folder in this archive to your Call of Duty 4 installation directory.

After you have doen this, you can run the run_prisonbreak.bat in you Call of Duty 4 directory to start the game with the CoDJumper mod and the map Prisonbreak loaded.
