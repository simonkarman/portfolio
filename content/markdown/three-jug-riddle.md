Riddle: You have a full 12 liter jug and empty 5 and 8 liter jugs. Can you measure exactly 6 liters?

As asked in [MindYourDecisions - The 3 Jugs Riddle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fZB4s38Ygg).

This problem dates to 1484 and was posed in the context of a milkman making a home delivery to a customer.

I tried to solve it visually using graph visualisation with graphviz.
