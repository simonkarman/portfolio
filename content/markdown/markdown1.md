An example of a markdown file!

## Markdown
This is some code

```javascript
function test() {
  console.log('Hello World');
}
```

This is some text with a [link](https://example.com) and a list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
  - Subitem 1
  - Subitem 2
- Item 4

This is a blockquote:

> This is a blockquote. It can span multiple lines and include other elements like code blocks, lists, and links.

## Outro
This is the outro of the markdown file. Markdown files can include any content you want, such as images, links, or additional text.
