On the University of Applied Science in Amsterdam, some colleagues students and I had the habit to let each other know when the current time of the day was [13:37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet). About a year ago I jokingly proposed to create this into a competitive website, which is actually what I created now.

Have fun trying to log the 13:37 time as fast as you can each day and try to get the highest score on the website! Visit the website on: ~~[www.1337log.com](http://www.1337log.com)~~ (see below for more information).

> Notice: As the domain name expired, the website is no longer online. I have no plans to bring it back online, but if you are interested in the code, please let me know and I can share it with you.

The front end was created using JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX requests. The backend was written in PHP and uses a MySQL server to store the data. All the AJAX request are POST request returning all data in JSON format, this makes the website easily extendable and maintainable.
