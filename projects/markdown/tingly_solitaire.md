During my internship at Tingly Games I created this game as a side project. The game was created within 2 weeks and put online on the Tingly Games website right after.

The game is created in HTML5. This game makes use of the Vector Font library I developed during my internship at Tingly Games. All games currently created by the company make use of my library.

You can play the game here:
