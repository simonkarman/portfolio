Detour is an app that can be used to take detours when cycling. A live demo can be found [here](https://karman.dev/detour/).

Simply, start cycling and whenever you reach an intersection: click somewhere on the screen to see what path to take.

In the following image you can see the first ever detour in Utrecht, Netherlands by Simon Karman and Matt Watson.
