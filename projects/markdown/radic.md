Radic is the improved sequel of the game HashRacer which I created in 2013. Both Radic and HashRacer where created in one single day.

Radic consists of an unlimited amount of tracks. The tracks are generated by the use of user-input. The user-input will be hashed and this will be used as a seed for the randomly generated tracks.

When you rolled the ball to the finish of a track your time along with your name and the seed used to generate the track will be stored in the database.

You can now challenge other players to beat your score by sharing the seed of your track.
