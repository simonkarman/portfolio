Lavagame is a 3D platformer game I created during my bachelor for Game Design 2. This was my first project in the Unity3D Game Engine. 

The goal of the game is to find the end. You can walk around with WASD and jump with the SPACEBAR.

I made use of key-lock mechanisms within the puzzle to make this game more fun to play. I alo made one key-lock reusable, which makes the puzzle more interesting.
