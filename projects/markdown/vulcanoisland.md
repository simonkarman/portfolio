Vulcano Island Generator is a project I created for my bachelors course Procedural Content Generation. [Vulcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcano "Vulcano") is a small volcanic Island near the coast of Italy.

Please read the documenation provided to understand how the generation process works. You can download the application to generate your own Vulcano Island.
