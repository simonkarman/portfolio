I participated in the Global Game Jam for the 5th time! Together with a random group of people I created an awesome game that won the audience award after 48 hours of hard work.

The exiting premise "Once a week; every week, it's Monday. Horrible, horrible Monday." describes the game 'O God It's Monday'. In this game you manage an office. It is 09:00 hour on Monday morning and you have to make sure that all employees of the office will have completed their daily routine at 17:00 hour. Doing this requires amazing planning skills and you must be able to take time to your advantage!
