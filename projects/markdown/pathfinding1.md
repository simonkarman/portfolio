Path-Finding with Dijkstra is a demo application for the path-finding algorithm by Dijkstra. In this demo application we visualized a simple path-finding problem. This demo application was created for a course during my bachelor together with Jorn Theunissen. We have written the application in Actionscript 3 using Flash.

In this demo you can change the position of the goal. The application will then find the shortest path towards that goal.
