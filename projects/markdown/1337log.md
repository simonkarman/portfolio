On the University of Applied Science in Amsterdam, me and some colleagues students had the habit to let each other know when the current time of the day was 13:37.

A about a year ago I jokingly proposed to create this into a competitive website, which is actually what I created now.

Have fun trying to log the 13:37 time as fast as you can each day and try to get the highest score on the website!

Visit the website on: ~~[www.1337log.com](http://www.1337log.com)~~ (no longer online)

The front end was created using JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX requests. The backend was written in PHP and uses a MySQL server to store the data. All the AJAX request are POST request returning all data in JSON format, this makes the website easily extandable and maintainable.
