Pushgame is a game about pushing blocks I created during my Bachelors Course: Game Design 1. Within this course you had to create a game that had balanced gameplay and for which the playability was smooth. The game was created in Actionscript 3 (which is no longer supported by major browsers).

In the game you control the black square with the face on it. Your goal is to find your way trough the puzzle to the white square with a face on it. You can move around with the arrowkeys.

I revised the content of the game based on user feedback. This was the first time that I gather feedback and improved the game using this feedback. To achieve this I did some playtests, so I could gather the feedback from people who played the game. These playtests helped me to adapt the overall difficulty of the game and tweak each individual level.
