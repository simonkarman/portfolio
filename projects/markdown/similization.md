Similization is an endless city generator inspired by the artwork of Kenney. I created this visualization of a endless city in HTML5 without the use of any libraries. 

When I stumbled upon Kenney awesome 2D assets for isometric cities and buildings I immediately wanted to created a city generator with them. So I did!

You can check out Similization [here](http://www.similization.nl)! Press F11 to view it in full screen. Note that although it runs on some mobile devices I didn't created it for those so it might not be fully supported.

# Update
*Friday 8th April 2016*
I have updated the similization project on [www.similization.nl](http://www.similization.nl). The similization project now makes use of the jSimon JavaScript Engine I created and used in several of my other JavaScript projects.

Further more biomes were added to the generation of the world, meaning different regions use different generation paramaters.

Also a settings option was added in which realtime changes can be made to which parts of the city are rendered. Such as roads only and single chunk only.
