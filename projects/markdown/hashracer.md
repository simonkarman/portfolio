HashRacer is a simple race game. You drive a car to the goal and try to do this in the least possible amount of time. 

The game was created in one day as a hobby project. It is created in Unity.

HashRacer consists of an unlimited amount of tracks. The tracks are generated by the use of user-input. The user-input will be hashed and this will be used as a seed for the randomly generated tracks.

When you finished a track your time along with your name and the seed used to generate the track will be stored in the database.

You can __no longer__ challenge other players, because the servers are offline. But you used to be able to beat scores of other players using the seed of their tracks.
