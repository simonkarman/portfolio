During my iternship at Tingly Games I created a Vector Font library that can be used to easily manage and render Vector Fonts in the HTML5 engine that is created by Tingly Games.

Using this library I also created a Word Art library for the developers at Tingly Games. In [this test environment](http://www.simonkarman.nl/projectdata/html5_wordart/index.html "this test environment") you can take a look at this Word Art viewer yourself.

__TODO Add live demo__ 

__Note__ Try to change the perpendicular type from rotate to skew.

Read everything this Word Art library can do in the documentation. Note that this documenation is only available in Dutch.
