[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/private/view/718869) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. For the 2023 edition of Advent of Code I solved all the puzzles using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

You can find my solutions to the puzzles on [github.com/simonkarman/advent-of-code-2023](https://github.com/simonkarman/advent-of-code-2023).

I especially enjoyed writing a solution to [puzzle 5](https://github.com/simonkarman/advent-of-code-2023/blob/main/src/day5.rs). I initially implemented the naive solution using a brute force approach, but later I found a more elegant solution using ranges.

During this month, I learned a lot about Rust's ownership and borrowing system while working on this project. It was a great experience overall! In January of 2024 I gave a Rust workshop to 25 colleagues at Xebia based on what I had learned about Rust during this project.
