I designed a logo for my website and products. By using this logo I want to more clearly communicate to the users of my projects that I created them. In my opinion it also gives a more professional look and feel to my products and website.

In the download link I provided logos, my business card design and video intros. These can be used when you want to credit for any project I created and are free of use as long as you let me know you used them.
