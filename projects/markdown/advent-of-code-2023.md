[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/private/view/718869) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

For the 2023 edition of Advent of Code I solved all the puzzles using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
