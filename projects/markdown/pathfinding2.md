Path-Finding with A* is a demo application for the path-finding algorithm A*. In this demo application we visualized a simple path-finding problem. This demo application was created for a course during my bachelor together with Jorn Theunissen. We have written the application in C# using XNA. 

In this demo you can change the position of the knight and the princess. The application will then find the shortest path from the knight to the princess.
