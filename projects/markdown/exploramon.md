Exploramon is an easy to play hex-based game. In this hex-based environment the players try to build a village. Building a villages costs great positional planning of the village layout and efficient gathering of resources. Keep in mind that while building your own village the other players are also trying to build their villages on the limited amount of hexes that are available to build on. Will you be able to create the most successful village?

I mainly created this project to experiment with a very flexible UI that felt responsive and smooth.
